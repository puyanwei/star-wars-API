# Star Wars Celebration

This was a challenge set working with the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/).

You must use the API to fetch data and return two strings after inputting two parameters; film, and character.

For the film, it must return the name of the film, and all the characters in the film in alphabetical order.

eg. "The Force Awakens: Luke Skywalker, Rey...[etc]"

For the character, it must return the films he or she has been in, also in alphabetical order.

eg. "Rey: The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi"

You must complete the function provided;

```
function run(film, character) {
    // code goes here
}
```
